Stats Reference
---------------

Gamemode names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since stats received from Fortnite's services changes all the time by adding 
new gamemodes and such, none of the gamemode names have been changed from the 
original response gotten from the request. Therefore, if you want to access a 
users solo stats, you must use the internal name for the solo gamemode:
``defaultsolo``.

There is no good, easy way of retrieving all these internal names. So for now
the best way you can do this is by fetching stats from someone that has played
a lot of different gamemode e.g. the user ``Dark`` (more known as Dakotaz) and
just write the gamemode names down.
